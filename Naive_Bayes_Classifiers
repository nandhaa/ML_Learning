Naive Bayes Classifier
----------------------
You have hunderds of thousands of data points and quite a few variables in your training data set.
In such situation, Naive Bayes comes in ATction.

This algorithm is mostly used in text classification and with problems having multiple classes.

Three types of Naive Bayes model under scikit learn library :

Gaussian: It is used in classification and it assumes that features follow a normal distribution.

Multinomial: It is used for discrete counts. For example, let’s say,  we have a text classification problem. 
Here we can consider bernoulli trials which is one step further and instead of “word occurring in the document”, 
we have “count how often word occurs in the document”, you can think of it as “number of times outcome number x_i is 
observed over the n trials”.

Bernoulli: The binomial model is useful if your feature vectors are binary (i.e. zeros and ones). 
One application would be text classification with ‘bag of words’ model where the 1s & 0s are “word occurs 
in the document” and “word does not occur in the document” respectively.
