SVN can be used for Classification and Regression. But mostly used for Classification.

Support Vectors are simply the co-ordinates of individual observation. 
Support Vector Machine is a frontier which best segregates the two classes

How does segregating ?
  It is segregating using hyper-plane.
  
Here, maximizing the distances between nearest data point (either class) 
and hyper-plane will help us to decide the right hyper-plane. This distance is called as Margin.
