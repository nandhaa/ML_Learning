KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. 
However, it is more widely used in classification problems in the industry. 

Where to use k-NN in the real world
Some examples of where you can use k-NN:

Classification: fraud detection. The model can update virtually instantly with new training examples 
since you’re just storing more data points, which allows quick adaptation to new methods of fraud.

Regression: predicting housing prices. In housing price prediction, literally being a “near neighbor” is 
actually a good indicator of being similar in price. k-NN is useful in domains where physical proximity matters.

Imputing missing training data. If one of the columns in your .csv has lots of missing values, 
you can impute the data by taking the mean or mode. k-NN could give you a somewhat more accurate guess at each missing value.
